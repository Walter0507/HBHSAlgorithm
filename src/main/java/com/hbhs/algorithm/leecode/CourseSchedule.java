/**
 * <b>Course Schedule</b><br>
 * <br>There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * <br>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * <br>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 * <br>For example:
 * <br>2, [[1,0]]
 * <br>There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 * <br>2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * <br>There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <br>Note:
 * <br>The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
